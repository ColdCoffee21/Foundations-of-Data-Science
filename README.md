# Foundations-of-Data-Science
A collection of all the codes that I had written for the Foundations of Data Science course.

The codes cover various topics such as
  - Dataframes
  - Reading different formats
  - Indexing
  - Merging
  - Reshaping dataframes
  - Sorting
  - Handling missing values
  - Outlier detection
  - Plotting (from line plots to heat maps)
  - Descriptive Statistics
  - Hypothesis Testing
  - Label Encoding
  - Linear Regression
  - Multivariate Regression
  - Lab work, Assignments, Evaluations
  - And a bunch of stuff that I tried out (Graph animation, TF, classifying MNIST fashion)

The file "Dataset_Analysis_Bigmart.ipynb" is a cumulation of all that was learnt. Consists of multiple steps taken for Analysis such as understanding the features of the bigmart dataset, finding out null/missing values, choosing an appropriate method to handle them, Hypothesis testing based on the dataset, label encoding, linear regression and multi-variate regression (3 trials).


I have to admit, it is slightly messy. But this is a reference of all the work I had done during my course!
